A revolutionary blend of technologies working together to create the ultimate cybersecurity platform:
* **[B]lockchain:** Immutable security logs with a quantum-secure consensus layer.
* **[I]nnovation:** Proactive threat hunting and 3D network visualization.
* **[Q]uantum:** Future-ready encryption resistant to quantum attacks.
* **[U]nified:** A seamless command center integrating all security domains.
* **[A]I:** Predictive analytics and automated incident response models.

## 🤖 [QUBISA](https://www.glocybs.com/qubisa) — Quantum-Enhanced AI
A paradigm shift in enterprise security. Developed by **GLOCYBS**, QUBISA integrates quantum computing principles with advanced machine learning to anticipate and neutralize AI-driven attacks before they manifest.

## 🦂 [G-FLEA](https://www.glocybs.com/quantumcomputing) — Swarm Mobility
Inspired by biological swarm intelligence, G-FLEA is an upcoming mobility infrastructure that functions as both an attacker (proactive testing) and respondent (reactive optimization).

## ⚛️ [G-QBS Lab](https://gqbs.glocybs.com/)
Our dedicated research facility focused on refining Quantum Search algorithms, optimizing amplitude amplification, and post-quantum cryptography.
